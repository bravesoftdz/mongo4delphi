Mongo Driver Requirements	- High priority
	* BSON serialization (OK considering the above types)
	* BSON deserialization
	*	full cursor support (e.g. support OP_GET_MORE operation)
	*	close exhausted cursors via OP_KILL_CURSORS
	*	support for running database commands
	*	handle query errors
	*	hint, explain, count, $where
	*	database profiling: set/get profiling level, get profiling info
	*	advanced connection management (replica sets, slave okay)
	*	automatic reconnection
	* authentication
